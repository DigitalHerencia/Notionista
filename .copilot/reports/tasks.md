# Tasks

## Implementation plan

1. Add canonical reference doc for the Competitive Advantage repository.
2. Add machine-readable external repo registry entry.
3. Update Copilot instructions to point to the external repo reference.
4. Add/refresh local environment placeholders for MCP-related tokens (kept out of git).
5. Run TypeScript checks/tests to confirm the repo remains healthy.
