# Using the built-in automations - GitHub Docs

> ## Excerpt
> You can use built-in workflows to automate your projects.

You can use built-in workflows to automate your projects.

Projects includes built-in workflows that you can use to update the **Status** of items based on certain events. For example, you can automatically set the status to **Todo** when an item is added to your project, close issues when the issue's status in your project is changed, or set the status to **Done** when an issue is closed.

When your project initializes, two workflows are enabled by default: When issues or pull requests in your project are closed, their status is set to **Done**, and when pull requests in your project are merged, their status is set to **Done**.

You can also configure workflows to automatically archive items when they meet set criteria and to automatically add items from a repository when they match a filter. For more information, see Archiving items automatically and Adding items automatically.

## Enabling a built-in workflow

You can enable or disable the built-in workflows for your project.

1.  Navigate to your project.
    
2.  In the top-right, click to open the menu.
    
3.  In the menu, click **Workflows**.
    
4.  Under "Default workflows," click on the workflow that you want to edit.
    
5.  In the top right, click **Edit**.
    
6.  Depending on the workflow you have selected, make changes to the fields to configure the workflow's behavior.
    
7.  To save your changes and enable the workflow, click **Save and turn on workflow**.
