# Tasks

## Implementation plan

1. Add canonical reference doc for the Competitive Advantage repository.
2. Add machine-readable external repo registry entry.
3. Update Copilot instructions to point to the external repo reference.
4. Add/refresh local environment placeholders for MCP-related tokens (kept out of git).
5. Run TypeScript checks/tests to confirm the repo remains healthy.

## Implementation plan (PROD-M1-P1.1-PRD completion)

1. Retrieve the parent Portfolio item `PROD-M1-P1.1-PRD – Problem Definition` and enumerate sub-items (T01–T05 Portfolio pages), tasks (T01–T05), and meetings linked to the project.
1. Confirm current state: T05 Portfolio page body is empty and T05 Task `Done=false`.
1. Validate meeting coverage: for each related meeting, read page blocks and confirm there are non-empty notes relevant to the tasks.
1. Draft T05 Feasibility Review content: executive summary, task completion status, team lead feedback, critical action items, and a feasibility checklist with Go/No-Go recommendation.
1. Propose changes (diff-style summary) and obtain explicit "Approved" for Notion writes.
1. Apply updates: append blocks to the T05 Portfolio page, mark the T05 Task `Done=true`, and (if needed) append minimal context blocks to any meeting pages that are only scaffolds.
1. Verify: re-fetch T05 Portfolio blocks and T05 Task state; confirm parent project shows all tasks complete.

## Implementation plan (OPS-M1-P1.1-OKR completion)

1. Retrieve the Project page `OPS-M1-P1.1-OKR – OKRs & Constraints` and enumerate linked tasks (T01–T05) and meetings for 2026-01-01..2026-01-07.
1. Verify meeting coverage: read each linked meeting page and classify it as (a) substantive notes present, or (b) template-only scaffold.
1. Confirm current state: retrieve the T05 task page blocks and determine whether the publish memo exists.
1. Draft the T05 publish memo using only verifiable meeting notes and canonical OKR/constraints content; include links to source pages.
1. Propose changes (diff-style summary) and obtain explicit approval for Notion writes.
1. Apply updates: append memo blocks to the T05 task page; append minimal “no notes captured” annotations to any scaffold-only meeting pages.
1. Verify: re-fetch T05 page blocks and the annotated meetings; confirm project consistency (task done flags vs deliverable content).

## Execution log (2026-01-08)

- Completed: appended T05 Feasibility Review content to the T05 Portfolio page.
- Completed: verified Daily Standup pages (2026-01-01 through 2026-01-07) and identified 2026-01-06 and 2026-01-07 as template-only scaffolds.
- Completed: appended a minimal context note to the 2026-01-06 and 2026-01-07 standup pages.
- Completed: verified T05 Task `Done` is `true`.

## Execution log (2026-01-08) — OPS (in progress)

- Verified Ops meetings for 2026-01-01..2026-01-07 are linked to the OPS OKR project.
- Confirmed 2026-01-06 and 2026-01-07 Ops meeting pages contain only template scaffolding.
- Confirmed T05 task exists and `Done=true`, but the page body currently contains no blocks (publish memo not yet written).
